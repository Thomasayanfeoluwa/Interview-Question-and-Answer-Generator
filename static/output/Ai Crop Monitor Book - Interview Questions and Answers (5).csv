Celery is used for asynchronous sending, and notification logs are stored in the MongoDB Atlas notifications collection."
13,"Compliance: How does the platform address GDPR-style logging, and what specific actions can farmers take regarding their data?",The platform addresses GDPR-style logging by encrypting farmer logs in the MongoDB Atlas cropmonitoring collection and implementing audit logs. Farmers can request deletion of their data.
14,"Explain the ""Adaptive Treatment Optimization"" differentiator. What data is used, and what advanced ML technique is mentioned for retraining the dosage optimization model?",Store historical actions in MongoDB Atlas.

18,Licensing & Provenance: Detail the process for maintaining licensing and provenance for datasets. What specific tools and documentation are required? What consent is needed from farmers?,"To maintain licensing and provenance for datasets, a manifest.csv file must be maintained with source, license, date, and sha256 checksum, using pandas to generate and validate it. This metadata is stored in the MongoDB Atlas cropmonitoring collection. DVC is used for dataset versioning with commands like dvc add data/ and dvc push. Farmer consent forms are required for uploads and are stored digitally in the MongoDB Atlas users collection with timestamps."
19,"Data Validation: How is data validation performed before training and deployment? What tool is used, and how is it integrated into the CI/CD pipeline?","Data validation is performed by adding Great Expectations tests for correct file counts and schema checks, with expectations defined in greatexpectations/expectations/ to validate MongoDB Atlas data.
